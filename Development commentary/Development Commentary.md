## Project Outline


This project will be an upgrade of my original prototype. This is based on similar souls-like games, mixed with elements from styles of games like dungeon crawlers, while including elements of weapon crafting. There are many things I wish to include in this project that will have improved since the prototype:


- Weapon crafting system
- Multiple distinct weapon types
- Updated animations and art and design for the world
- More dungeons, with ranging difficulty due to more enemies or bosses.


There are a few things I know I will have an issue with. I am not the most confident in my level of design skills, so I know I will need to do a lot of research on how people feel about art and design. But in the end I know that I ultimatly will not need to do too much work, I will be more focusing on a functioning game rather than a pretty game.
I additionally have not dabbled with audio before, so setting it up will be a big challenge for me, though I am confident with enough practice and testing I can get it set up.
Ultimatly I am not too worried for this. With a lot of user testing and constant feedback I can fine tune this project.

## Research

### Methodology

Deciding on the type of game to develop was a challenging process. Initially, I considered focusing on games like [Dark Souls](https://store.steampowered.com/app/570940/DARK_SOULS_REMASTERED/) (DARK SOULS™: REMASTERED on Steam, n.d.), one of the most renowned titles in the souls-like adventure genre. This approach aligned with the original direction of my project. However, as I continued to refine my ideas, I expanded my scope and explored additional sources of inspiration. One such source was Vault Hunters (Iskallia, n.d.), a game I had previously incorporated into my prototype. This modpack sparked the idea of introducing random weapon stats and other mechanics, such as weapon reforging. Following this, I was advised to look into Mount and Blade: Bannerlord II (TaleWorlds Entertainment, n.d.), which features an intricate weapon 
crafting system that I could adapt to enhance my own project. By drawing on these diverse influences, I aim to create a game that combines elements of exploration, randomization, and deep customization.

### Game Sources

The first game I am examining is Mount and Blade: Bannerlord II (TaleWorlds Entertainment, n.d.), which features a highly detailed weapon crafting system. In this system, the rarity of resources required to craft higher-tier weapons increases as the player seeks to create more advanced items. While I have not played the game personally, I have researched player feedback through its [Steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/261550/Mount__Blade_II_Bannerlord/) (TaleWorlds Entertainment, n.d.), which consistently receives a "Very Positive" rating, suggesting widespread enjoyment of the crafting system. 
In the game, players craft weapons by combining individual parts, such as a dagger head with a small hilt or a rake head with a long pole to create a pike. This system allows for creative combinations, making the crafting process increasingly engaging as more options become available. I drew inspiration from this design, particularly the flexibility it offers in crafting unique, custom weapons. According to the [documentation](https://mountandblade.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_crafting) (Mount & Blade Fandom, 2025), this flexibility leads to a satisfying experience for players who take pride in their personalized creations.

*Figure 1 - An example of weapons made in Bannerlord.*

I aim to incorporate a similar crafting system in my own game, focusing on combining different weapon components like blades and handles. However, unlike *Bannerlord II*, I do not plan to replicate the tiered weapon system or cosmetic elements, as I believe alternative mechanics will work better for my specific design.

<br>

I have also examined [Vault Hunters](https://vaulthunters.gg/) (Iskallia, s.d.), a Minecraft modpack that emphasizes dungeon running. In this modpack, players explore various vaults to discover weapons and items that can be used to modify or upgrade their existing gear. One aspect I particularly appreciate about Vault Hunters is its design, which encourages exploration and persistence by requiring players to keep trying until they acquire the desired items. This mechanic ensures that players remain engaged, continually striving to improve their weapons and overall gameplay. While I do not intend to replicate Vault Hunters entirely, as that would lack originality, I plan to incorporate elements of its system into my own game. Specifically, I am interested in adopting the concept of items that allow players to reset the stats of their weapons. When combined with ideas drawn from Mount and Blade: Bannerlord II (TaleWorlds Entertainment, n.d.), this could result in an intriguing and dynamic crafting system that balances both customization and progression.

*Figure 2 - An example of the weapon reforging system in Vault Hunters.*

<br>

Finally I looked at a newer game called Kingdom come deliverance 2 (Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, s.d.)
In Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2(Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, s.d.), the weapon forging system is a skill-based process that emphasizes timing and craftsmanship.

![alt text]( https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TransgenderQueen/Final-Major-Project/refs/heads/main/Development%20commentary/Henry%20smithing.avif )
*Figure 3 - An example of the smithing minigame in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2* 

 - Players begin by gathering materials and blueprints, then heating metal in a furnace until it reaches the perfect temperature. Using bellows to maintain the fire, the player must then transfer the heated metal to an anvil, where the real forging begins.
 - The hammering process is rhythm-based—matching the beat of Henry's whistle improves efficiency and ensures even shaping. Sparks and sound cues help guide successful strikes, and maintaining consistent pressure across the metal is key to crafting high-quality weapons.
 - As the metal cools, players must return it to the furnace to reheat it, sometimes multiple times throughout the process. Once shaped, the weapon is quenched in water to finalize its durability and combat readiness. The quality of the finished item depends on craftsmanship skill, timing, and technique.
 - I really like how they created the weapon crafting system, keeping it immersive and worthwhile. The player could eventually make all of the endgame weapons and armour necessary, keeping the player happy and ready to play the game with what they made. Ultimatly I will prehaps take ideas from this game, but not take heavy insipiration, due to the fact that there is a lot of realism in this game that would not function with my own game.


### Academic Sources

In the journel titled "Crafting in video games"(Grow et al., 2017), it explains what a crafting game is and how they can change someones playstyle or how they may feel about a game. Such notable games are Minecraft(Welcome to the official site of Minecraft, s.d.), which is the most popular game of all time, but one of the most popular crafting games ever. This does this very well by making sure you are the only one making every single block, item, piece of food, piece of armour and weapon. This means people gain a lot of emotional attachments, meaning that every single hard fought item they could create will be saved and cherished. Items such as the Elytra or a players first diamond pickaxe will be saved and cherished by players.
So I want to ensure that players will enjoy what they can play as well as feeling a sense of accomplishment when getting newer weapons.

So, what I ended up looking into was [Agile methodology](https://agilemanifesto.org/) (Manifesto for Agile Software Development, s.d.), specifically the idea of using sprints to break down progress into manageable chunks. The goal was to keep the development process iterative, so instead of trying to build everything all at once, I’d focus on small, incremental improvements and just keep looping back to the start after each sprint to refine things. It’s all about making consistent progress and being flexible with how things evolve, which seemed like a smart way to avoid getting stuck or overwhelmed.


On top of that, I also took some inspiration from a game called Star Citizen(Roberts Space Industries | Follow the development of Star Citizen and Squadron 42 - Roberts Space Industries | Follow the development of Star Citizen and Squadron 42, s.d.).
The way they approach development is by releasing small patches that gradually add more content over time, rather than trying to do everything at once. It’s a slower, more steady process, but it works for them. I thought this approach could work well for my project too—pushing out small updates regularly, instead of waiting until everything is “perfect.” This was the core of my methodology: a steady, ongoing push forward that builds up over time.

### Documentation Sources

So, one of the best finds during development was this video on getting gamepads to work with menus. I had been scratching my head over how to implement gamepad support in a way that felt natural for navigating through menus, and it was an issue I couldn't figure out how to solve. But after searching, I came across this video, and it was an immediate help. It broke everything down step by step, covering all the little details I’d missed, and it instantly solved a massive problem I had.


Not only did it save me a ton of time, but it gave me a better understanding of how to handle user input more intuitively. I had been thinking about this feature for a while but wasn't sure how to approach it—this video just laid it out in such a simple, clear manner. It was like a lightbulb moment. I was able to implement the solution right away, and it felt satisfying to see it all come together. Sometimes the right resource at the right time can make all the difference, and that video was one of those moments for me.
Additonally I came across another issue wth this. When x-box controllers were plugged into Unreal Engine, there are chances that the character will constantly look down while also moving to the left. Ultimaltly not an issue for players as it only effects the editor not the final build.

Crafting System Video:
Then, I came across another video that was all about building crafting systems in games, which was pretty eye-opening. I was already thinking about how I wanted crafting to work in my game, but this video showed me some interesting techniques and design patterns that I hadn’t considered. Even though I didn’t end up using the exact system they were showing, it gave me tons of new ideas about how to approach it.


What was cool about it was that it got me thinking beyond the basic crafting mechanic. I started brainstorming ways to make the system feel more dynamic—things like adding more layers of customization, different materials, or ways to integrate crafting into the larger game world. The video gave me the tools to think about crafting not just as a standalone feature, but as something that could add depth to the overall experience.

Ultimately, I didn’t implement the system as shown in the video, but it helped shape how I designed my approach. And that’s exactly what this video did for me—it expanded my thinking and helped me refine my own vision for the crafting system.

## Implementation

### Process
For my project, I needed to create a system that allowed me to reroll for weapons stats. This meant that I needed to call only a certain part of the system that created the stats while ignoring the system that allowed the rarity of the weapons and weapon type.

However, as I went to create the system that did it, I noticed a lot of issues with the original system. When making a weapon, it would start the stat system before then deciding what weapon type and rarity it was. This was increadibly inefficent and after plenty of testing, it would often not work correctly, having different outcomes roughly about 70% of the time.
Eventually I came up with a final outcome. I had to reorginize the system. I needed to put the weapon rarity and type before any other systems began to work.

This took a lot of work, before I finally ended up with a system that looked like this.
Here I was then able to use it all for all weapon changes in the fufutre. This was because I could call the event from any other blueprint, rather than calling two seperate functions at once.

*Figure 4 - A video showcasing the collection of cores in my game*

- However, one thing I did not expect to be much of an issue was going to be the core system. I had created the core system as a way to create a gameplay loop. In order for players to upgrade or forge their own weapons, they would have to head into the dungeons, killing enemies along the way to gain cores of varying power. Each higher upgrade would require more and more cores.

- Once gained enough, the players can head towards their base of operations and quickly begin to use their newly gained cores to upgrade their weapons durability.

- This part took the longest to actually make. The functionality of upgrading weapons did not take long, as seen here. However, the longer part of it was the functionality that allowed it to use certain amounts of cores. This took the longest out of everything I had to try and work on. 

<br>

<iframe src="https://blueprintue.com/render/z-u4jshx/" width="1000" height="600" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<br>

- But the weapon crafting system was the hardest part of it all. I had to create a tracker for how many cores the last option selected had, so that it would not constantly add more and more to what was required. I then had to add different indexes for each process I was doing.

- Ultimatly I think I made the user interface for players look rather nice, making it really quite simple for everyone to understand to follow the instructions laid out.

### New Approaches  


### Testing

This was my favorite part of making my game. I always enjoy seeing people try out my game. For three of the tests I sat in the room with them as they tested what I had. This was during spint weeks 5-6

- Each of the testers instantly began to ask me what to do as soon as they loaded into the game. I told them to read the text.
- They all began by instantly testing the weapons, using the attacks and abilities. First piece of feedback was that the weapon animations were fun.
- The next peice of information they all had for me was that they all enjoyed the goofieness of the enemies sliding across the floor. Though one mentioned that it was annoying they didnt have walking animations.

- The last piece of positive feedback they all had for me was the fact that the crouching I implimented into the game was fun.

<iframe src="https://blueprintue.com/render/w7j0g03h/" width="1000" height="600" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>

*Figure 6 - Shows a blueprint allowing the player to imitate crouching by simply just squishing their hight by 50%, allowing for a very funny image. This was greatly received as something silly and endearing by players.*


### Later testing

<br>

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TransgenderQueen/Final-Major-Project/refs/heads/main/Development%20commentary/Testing%20Image%201.png)
*Figure 7 - A graph showing players experiance. 1 being not at all, 10 to max*

*Figure 8 - A graph showing their enjoyment of mechanics.*

<br>
So, I had a lot of testers run through the game so that I could have a look and see how it would all work.

- A few of them found that the game felt rough and unpolished. The game was apparently rather unintuative, not showing the players where to go and what to do.




As a result of all of these issues I added more things, working on their feedback:

- A settings menu, now allowing the player to tone down the graphics settings if and when required
- A controll menu, allowing the players to look and see what buttons could do what, both for controller and mouse and keyboard.
- Better UI. The testers had complained that the game felt rather harsh when attemping to read through the ui. For example, they didnt know what "BC, HC and SC" meant. So as a result, I then went to add more incofmration by expanding on what I had written, leading it to say "Basic Core, Higher Core, Super Core"

- The weapon craftiing system. I did not realise when giving the build to the testers, it had not been actually released. None of the systems had been actually made, nor added. Which was a major issue of course. So in the end, I quickly added it all in, happy with the final result.


### Technical Difficulties

During this project, I had come up with plenty of new ideas, begining to build them up as blueprints.
However, as I continued to work on the project, I found myself hating the project more and more, being unable to work on it. As I looked at what I had made, i found myself hating it. But I eventually couldnt deal with what I worked on and deleted it all in anger. This was not a good idea, as it meant I had lost a considerable amount of work.
However, this meant I could go back and work on everything from a fresh start, learning from my mistakes.

One major issue I was having in the game, was the save states. In all of my games I have never actually used any save states. So this was my first forray into using such a thing.
This was where I made a mistake. I created a stat for my weapon, pushing it into an array. I thought this would work exactly, allowing me to send that directly to the save state. This, however, was definatly not the right way to go about this issue, as it ended up not working at all.

Ecentually, using this documentation https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/saving-and-loading-your-game-in-unreal-engine (Saving and Loading Your Game in Unreal Engine | Unreal Engine 5.5 Documentation | Epic Developer Community, s.d.)
I fiured out what I was actually doing wrong. It was rather embaressing to figure out how I was doing wrong.
Eventually though I quickly began to get it to work, which is now able to do so.

## Reflection

### Research Effectiveness  

Ultimtly I think the research I used was really effective. The help from Bannerlord(Mount&Blade II Bannerlord - TaleWorlds Entertainment, s.d.) was increadiblyt useful. It was perfect as a first step in the right way.
The look at Kingdom Come Deliverance 2(Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, s.d.) was also a good idea, it actually provided me ways to push this foreward and gave me plenty of ideas.

Finally the document I looked at Crafting in video games"(Grow et al., 2017) was also a good help. It give me a good idea and explain how crafting items can become a massive help and idea.

### Positive Analysis

The random weapon system, while relatively simple, proved to be quite effective. It introduced enough variety to keep gameplay engaging without adding unnecessary complexity. I am particularly proud of how it turned out, as it fulfilled its purpose well and contributed positively to the overall game experience. Similarly, I was pleased with the implementation of the weapon crafting system. It offered players a degree of control over their loadouts, which complemented the randomness of the weapon drops and encouraged experimentation. One of my favorite aspects of the project, however, was finalizing the user interface. Although UI design is not my strongest skill, I was proud of the result. I focused on keeping the layout clean and organized, ensuring that elements were neither too cluttered nor too small. This attention to detail helped create a functional and visually appealing interface that supported the overall user experience.

### Negative Analysis  


The main issue here, honestly, was a mix of creative burnout and time pressure. I hit a point where I just ran out of ideas and couldn’t find the motivation to push things forward. Inspiration dried up, and I didn’t have a clear direction anymore. On top of that, I made a few bad calls that didn’t help and ended up dragging the whole thing down. Looking back, I can see where it started to fall apart, and a lot of that comes down to me just not being in the right headspace to keep it going.


Alongside this, there was also a small issue of me not having internet commection for two weeks, causing me to be unable to work on a lot of my necessary work as I was unable to check online. Ultimatly there were a lot of issues for the etiererty of this project, meaning I was enjoying it less and less and less.


### Next Time


In future projects, I will place greater emphasis on planning to avoid starting without adequate preparation. One of the main challenges I faced was a lack of pacing, which resulted in feeling overwhelmed and eventually led to burnout. Although I initially used a Trello board to manage my tasks, its effectiveness declined over time as the structure broke down. This experience highlighted the importance of consistent organization throughout a project. Additionally, I have realized the value of choosing projects that genuinely sustain my interest. In this case, I lost motivation midway through, which made it difficult to maintain momentum and negatively affected the quality of my final output. Going forward, I will be more deliberate in both project selection and time management to ensure better outcomes.
